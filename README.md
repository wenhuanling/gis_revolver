# gis_revolver
WH's GIS revolver script

This is the script that takes in input of the files and run the revolver package("caravagn/revolver") on R.

This script takes the following files (HG38):
1. MAF files (generated by funcotator)
2. loci.tsv (generated by pyclone)

The script works by combining all the MAF files together as part of the input for the loci files, then combining the loci files together as one final output.

The script then runs the revolver steps and lastly generate the figures.
